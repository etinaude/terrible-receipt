Come up with a 140 character unhinged idea for a thing that could be made in four days by a clever person. The idea could satirize an existing field or topic such as tech, science, art, writing, etc, or it could lean into absurdism.

Ideas can be up to PG-13. Your response should be at most 140 characters and not include a name or any formatting. It should be original, not drawing from existing projects.

Projects could be physical, digital, written, or some other form of art. This project is: ${project_type} and involves ${tech_amount}.

IMPORTANT: the idea should be TERRIBLE! Silly, reckless, and unhinged.

Here are some examples of previous ideas:
- Electric Scooter + Green Screen + Zoom = Classroom Commute
- Alexa powered toilet
- Bluetooth gumboots
- Invisible ink clock
